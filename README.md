## Introduction

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms in Rust. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you will find valuable content here to enhance your understanding and skills.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this repository, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some familiarity with Rust. If you're new to Rust, consider going through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) first.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-path.git
    cd rust-path
    ```

2. **Install Rust:**
   Follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust.

3. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

4. **Run tests:**

    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

Delve into binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more, with various tree operations.

### Graphs

Learn about graph representations, traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), and more advanced graph algorithms.

### Hash Tables

Understand the implementation of hash tables, handling collisions, and common operations.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Implement and analyze various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.

### Searching

Learn about linear search, binary search, and more advanced searching techniques.

### Dynamic Programming

Understand dynamic programming concepts with examples such as the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and more.

### Graph Algorithms
